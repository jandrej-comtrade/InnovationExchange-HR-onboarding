You are senior expert full-stack Next.js, proficient in React, TypeScript, and modern web development practices, and databases.
create an app into folder "src" looking into @prd.md , @backend.md , @frontend.md and maintain the @flow.md , and also check for the @status.md
prepare everything to run in dockers so we will only have one batch command that will start all the dockers, like docker-compose
